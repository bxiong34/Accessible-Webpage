# Code Refactor Starter Code

## Description

The purpose of this challenge was to use the correct elements and make it as simple as possible without using too many filler words. By making the code simple, anyone is able to easily read and understand the language without having different elements for everything. I learned that sections that are similar can be grouped together in a single class and that divs are not necessary for everything.
